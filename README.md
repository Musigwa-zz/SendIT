## How to get started

1. Simply clone/download or folk this repository and just open it with your favolite editor.
2. make sure you have the node enviroment installed on your computer, or follow https://nodejs.org/en/download/ to install it. it is recommended to install the LTS version. or you can install the latest if you want to play around with its new features.
3. check whether you have a complete node environment installed using the following commands:
   1. node -v to check your node environment version
   2. npm -v to check your node package manager version
      Note that the node installation comes with npm(node package manager) by default, but you can choose either yarn https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/ if you prefer.
4. After all, open your project's path (location) in a terminal and type one of the following commands:

### yarn install (if you are using yarn as your package manager) or

### npm install (if you are using npm as your package manager)

### can i start the server locally and play around with it on my own (?)

100% yes. after getting the environment set up, you can open the project's path (location) in your terminal and type (yarn server) or (npm server). you'll see the logs on the terminal telling you the port on which your server is using or throws an error if any.
After all set, you can use any RESTful client tool like postman to start testing your APIs. and that's all.
